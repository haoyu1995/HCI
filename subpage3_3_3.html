            <h1>How Is Depression Treated?</h1>
            <p>There's no one proven way that people recover from depression, and it's different for everyone. However, there are a range of effective treatments and health professionals who can help you on the road to recovery. </p>
            <p>There are also plenty of things you can do for yourself to recover and stay well. The important thing is finding the right treatment and the right health professional for your needs. </p>
            <h1>1.Psychological treatments for depression</h1>
            <p>-Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)</p>
            <p>CBT is a structured psychological treatment which recognises that the way we think (cognition) and act (behaviour) affects the way we feel. CBT is one of the most effective treatments for depression, and has been found to be useful for a wide range of ages, including children, adolescents, adults and older people. </p>
            <p>-Interpersonal therapy (IPT)</p>
            <p>IPT is a structured psychological therapy that focuses on problems in personal relationships and the skills needed to deal with these. IPT is based on the idea that relationship problems can have a significant effect on someone experiencing depression, and can even contribute to the cause.

            IPT helps you recognise patterns in your relationships that make you more vulnerable to depression. Identifying these patterns means you can focus on improving relationships, coping with grief and finding new ways to get along with others.</p>
            <p>-Behaviour therapy</p>
            <p>While behaviour therapy is a major component of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), unlike CBT it doesn’t attempt to change beliefs and attitudes. Instead it focuses on encouraging activities that are rewarding, pleasant or satisfying, aiming to reverse the patterns of avoidance, withdrawal and inactivity that make depression worse.</p>
            <h1>2.Medical treatments for depression</h1>
            <p>The main medical treatment for depression is antidepressant medication. There's a lot of misinformation about antidepressant medication and while there is no simple explanation as to how it works, it can be very useful in the treatment of moderate to severe depression and some anxiety disorders.</p>
            <p>If you're experiencing moderate to severe depression your doctor may prescribe antidepressant medication, along with psychological treatments. Antidepressants are sometimes prescribed when other treatments have not been successful or when psychological treatments aren't possible due to the severity of the condition or a lack of access to the treatment.</p>
            <p>People with more severe forms of depression (bipolar disorder and psychosis) generally need to be treated with medication. This may include one or a combination of mood stabilisers, anti-psychotic drugs and antidepressants.</p>
            <p>-which antidepressant should be used?</p>
            <p>Making a decision about which antidepressant is best for each individual can be complex. The decision is made in consultation with your doctor, after careful assessment and consideration. You can help your doctor's assessment by providing as much information as possible about yourself and your medical history. Important factors include your age, symptoms, other medications and, if female, whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding.

There are many different types of antidepressant medication which have been shown to work, but their effectiveness differs from person to person. Antidepressants take at least two weeks before they start to help, and it may also take some time for the doctor to find the most suitable medication and dosage.</p>
            <p>-What are the side effects?</p>
            <p>Antidepressants can make you feel better, but they won't change your personality or make you feel happy all the time. Like taking any other medication, some people will experience some side effects. Depending on which medication is taken, common side effects can include nausea, headaches, anxiety, sweating, dizziness, agitation, weight gain, dry mouth and sexual difficulties (e.g. difficulty becoming/staying aroused).

Some of these symptoms can be short-lived, but people who experience any of these symptoms should tell their doctor, as there are ways of minimising them. The likelihood of a particular side effect happening varies between individuals and medications.</p>
            <h1>3.Other sources of support</h1>
            <p>If left untreated, depression and anxiety can go on for months, even years. The good news is that a range of effective treatments are available, as well as things you can do yourself to recover and stay well.</p>
            <p>Different treatments work for different people, and it’s best to speak to your GP or mental health professional about your options and preferences. If you’ve taken the first step and talked through some treatment options with a health professional, you might like to try a few of the following ideas for lifestyle changes and social support. Most people find that a combination of things work best.</p>
            <p>It's important to remember that recovery can take time, and just as no two people are the same, neither are their recoveries. Be patient and go easy on yourself.</p>
